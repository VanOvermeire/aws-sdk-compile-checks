# AWS SDK Retrieve Required Properties

Code for retrieving the required properties of AWS Client builders from the documentation pages.
Rayon is used to speed things up, as most things in the code can be done in parallel.
The latest version of the SDK is chosen by default.

Run the Rust code (`cargo run`) and do what you like with the output in the `output` folder, or use `build.sh`.
